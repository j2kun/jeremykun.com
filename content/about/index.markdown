My name is Jeremy Kun. I'm currently an engineer at Google. I earned a PhD in mathematics from the University of Illinois at Chicago, where my advisor was [Lev Reyzin](http://levreyzin.com/). Here's [a long thing I wrote](https://medium.com/@jeremyjkun/my-graduate-career-in-math-85fd4efb0fa9#.s5si561ir) about my graduate school experience. I did my undergraduate degree at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in mathematics and computer science.

I have a thorough background in computer science, but my most exciting experiences there always stemmed from elegant (and uncoincidentally mathematical) solutions to programming problems. This blog is a presentation of the interesting solutions I come across, and an exploration of the deeper mathematical ideas therein. Most often this means exploring the mathematical structure of a problem to lubricate the cogs of algorithm design. In seldom cases, this involves using programs to reason about mathematical theory.

I try to reserve this blog for technical material, and post articles for a general audience on [my medium blog](https://medium.com/@jeremyjkun) (and others, see this [historical archive](https://github.com/j2kun/general-audience-math-essays)).

### For potential employers or research partners


Think of this blog as a three-fold portfolio: code, technical writing, and distillations of ideas from various mathematical and software fields. Most of the work on this blog has followed the recipe:



	  1. Stumble upon a topic that sounds fascinating, or become fed up with my own ignorance of some area of mathematics or programming, or come up with an original question or idea.
	  2. Read books, papers, blogs, and watch lectures online about the topic.
	  3. Come up with a small software project that uses the idea in a nontrivial way.
	  4. Write a [main content post](http://jeremykun.wordpress.com/main-content/) explaining and demonstrating the project.
	  5. Write a [primer post](http://jeremykun.wordpress.com/primers/) explaining the background mathematics.
	  6. Look for ways to expand, generalize, or relate the idea to projects past and forthcoming.

"Main Content" posts contain software, while "Primers" are usually math-only. All source code used in making posts is available at my [Github page](http://github.com/j2kun).

Here is a list of the languages used in some nontrivial capacity (using nontrivial features of the language) on this blog so far:



	  * Python
	  * Mathematica
	  * Javascript
	  * Java
	  * C++
	  * Racket
	  * Standard ML
	  * Processing
