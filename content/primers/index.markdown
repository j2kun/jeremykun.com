As a fair warning to the reader, these primers are a bit more terse than what you'd find in your average textbook. I only introduce the bare minimum required to understand the [main content](http://jeremykun.wordpress.com/main-content/) posts, so there are carefully chosen gaps whose exclusion is necessary for time's sake. If the reader is confused about something, or wants a deeper explanation of a concept we deliberately leave out, feel free to leave a comment asking about it and we will do our best to fill in the gaps.
