**Problem**: Find the sum of the first 1000 natural numbers.

**Solution**: Write the numbers twice as follows:


 $\begin{matrix} 1 & + & 2 & + & \dots & + & 999 & + & 1000 \\ 1000 & + & 999 & + & \dots & + & 2 & + & 1 \end{matrix}$




Summing the numbers in each column, we have:




$2 (1 + 2 + \dots + 1000) = 1001 + 1001 + \dots + 1001$ (1000 times)




And dividing by two we have




$1 + 2 + \dots + 1000 = \frac{1000 * 1001}{2} = 500500$




This method clearly works not just for 1000, but any natural number $n$.




**Problem**: Find the sum of the squares of the first $n$ natural numbers




**Solution**: Arrange the numbers three times, in triangles as follows:

Here we prove what is obvious from the picture: that the numbers in the "sum" triangle work out as expected.

In the leftmost triangle, there are $i$ copies of $i$ in the $i$th row (indexing from 1), so the sum of the $i$th row is $i^2$, and the sum of all the numbers in the triangle is $(1^2 + 2^2 + \dots + n^2)$. Since the other two "summand" triangles are just rotations of the first triangle, their sums are also the sum of the first $n$ squares.

In the "sum" triangle at the $i$th row $j$ spaces from the left (indexing both from zero), we have the value $(1+i) + (n-i+j) + (n-j) = 2n+1$. In each triangle there are $1 + 2 + \dots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ different numbers (as per the first proof), so there are that many copies of $2n+1$ in the fourth triangle. Summing up the fourth triangle gives three times our desired result, and hence


$3(1^2 + 2^2 + \dots + n^2) = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{2}$, or
$(1^2+2^2+\dots + n^2) = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$


This second proof was shown to me by Sándor Dobos, a professor of mine in Budapest whom I remember fondly.
