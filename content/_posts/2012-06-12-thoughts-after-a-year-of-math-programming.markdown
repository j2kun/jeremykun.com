After a year of writing this blog, what have I learned about the nature of the relationship between computer programs and mathematics? Here are a few notes that sum up my thoughts, roughly in order of how strongly I agree with them. I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments.

	  1. Programming is _absolutely great_ for exploring questions and automating tasks. Mathematics is _absolutely great _for distilling the soul of a problem.
	  2. Programming is fueled by the excitement of what can be done. Mathematics is fueled by the excitement of how things relate, and why they relate.
	  3. Good mathematics makes for short programs.
	  4. Good mathematics can be sloppy. Good programs cannot.
	  5. Useful algorithms can come from any branch of mathematics, so it is best to be familiar with them all (at least a little).
	  6. Most programs written for the real world use no mathematics beyond the level of an average twelve-year-old, but _every_ program indirectly relies on sophisticated mathematics in an essential way.
	  7. Programs that are fun, exciting, or generative invariably utilize some branch of mathematics.
	  8. Short programs that do mathematical things are prohibitively mystical until you've spent weeks on the mathematical background. Once those weeks are spent, everything is so obvious it's trivial.
	  9. The hard question in software design is: how can we take this to extremes? The easy, natural question in mathematics is often: what happens when we take this to extremes?
	  10. Abstraction in a program is strikingly similar to abstraction in mathematics, but the former takes a lot of work while the latter is instantaneous.
