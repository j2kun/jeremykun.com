Recalling our series on [Conway's Game of Life](http://jeremykun.wordpress.com/2011/06/29/conways-game-of-life/), here is an implementation of Life _within_Â Life. Unfortunately, [it does not "prove" what I hoped it might](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/8805/if-an-abstract-machine-can-simulate-itself-does-that-make-it-turing-complete), so unless a reader has a suggestion on what this demonstration proves, it doesn't belong in the proof gallery. But it sure is impressive.
