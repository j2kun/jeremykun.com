[polldaddy poll=6124681]


I'm always looking for new ideas to write about on this blog. In fact, almost every day I stumble upon [a Wikipedia page for something I never knew about before](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bees_algorithm), and want to start researching it right away! So give a response to what sounds the most interesting, or better yet what you want to read about that isn't on the list.

I'd also like to know what parts of the blog you readers enjoy the most. So far my only gauge of that is from page hits and comments. It seems that my Python and Racket primers garner the most attention, and while I haven't found any good false proofs recently, those are a big hit. So leave a comment with some feedback, and this blog will become all the better for it!
