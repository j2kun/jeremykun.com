I am down to the home stretch for publishing my upcoming book, "A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics." I don't have an exact publication date—I'm self publishing—but after months of editing, I've only got two chapters left in which to _apply_ edits that I've already marked up in my physical copy. That and some notes from external reviewers, and adding jokes and anecdotes and fun exercises as time allows.

I'm committing to publishing by the end of the year. When that happens I'll post here and also on [the book's mailing list](https://jeremykun.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=99aa071e97df95d3a140b1a3f&id=fbe11f6b59). Here's a sneak preview of the [table of contents](https://pim-book.github.io/pdf/pim_toc.pdf). And a shot of the cover design (still a work in progress)
